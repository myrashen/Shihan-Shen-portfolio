# The final data story
Here is my story on Shorthand.

[The Road to EV Adoption: Should Incentives Policy Continue?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/copy/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

1: Overall, I have narrowed down the target audience mainly to the policy makers. As EV consumers' preferences on EVs provided background information about EV consumption, what I want to focus on is to tell a story about US incentives do encourage the EV sales. Such an effort can help us achieve more on green transition. However, the President Trump and his administration expressed intention to repeal the incentives. Our pace of going green would slow down. Through my storytelling with data, I want to persuade the policy makers to have deep consideration on that.

2. I have added the section of calling to actions. Initially, I didn't inclued any call-to-action because I have several audiences at first. After I narrowing down to the policy makers, I would like to call for consideration on the repeal of EV tax credits from Congress.

3. I have changed some links I quoted to make sure they work well.

## The audience

I have narrowed down the target audience mainly to the policy makers.

Through my storytelling with data, I want to persuade the policy makers to have deep consideration on that.

## Final design decisions

1. I have removed the graph of incentive policies in China because I don't want to mess the whole story up and make it uncohesive. I don't meant to do a comparison.

2. I have added several labels on the graphs to directly show the number. For example, in the 'incentives' graph, the original size of circles are similar. Adding percent directly on the circle help understand the preferences on EV incentives.

3. I have updated the sources on IRA timeline page.

## AI acknowledgements

I have used GenAI to brainstorm on the general outline of my storytelling. Besides, I have used GenAI to extract dataset and generate csv files to do data visualizations in Tableau.

# Final thoughts

1. Overall Experience & Challenges:

   From Part one to Part three, the structure of my storytelling became more clear and focused. I initially had a broad topic and didnot target on main audience, leaving a large scope to talk about which made the whole story too vague. I thought when doing the storytelling the most important is to find the main audience you want to reach out. Only when targeted on the audience can we further do more complete and persuasive storytelling.

2. Time Constraints:

   When doing the project, I found that the most time I spent on was to find data in such enormous dataset sources. Sometimes what we can find is not we initially want. But we can still delve into it and find some data supportive.

3. Lessons for Future Work

   Overall, from this project, I realized that the importance of defining the target audience early to help structure the narrative. Besides, a clear and compelling CTA at the end is crucial, especially for policy-related topics. Future projects should explicitly direct the audience toward an action. Finally, do research and find data as much as possible.
