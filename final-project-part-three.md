# The final data story
Here is my story on Shorthand.

[The Road to EV Adoption: Should Incentives Policy Continue?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/copy/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
1: Overall, I have narrowed down the target audience mainly to the policy makers. As EV consumers' preferences on EVs provided background information about EV consumption, what I want to focus on is to tell a story about US incentives do encourage the EV sales. Such an effort can help us achieve more on green transition. However, the President Trump and his administration expressed intention to repeal the incentives. Our pace of going green would slow down. Through my storytelling with data, I want to persuade the policy makers to have deep consideration on that.
2. I have added the section of calling to actions. Initially, I didn't inclued any call-to-action because I have several audiences at first. After I narrowing down to the policy makers, I would like to call for consideration on the repeal of EV tax credits from Congress.
3. I have changed some links I quoted to make sure they work well.

## The audience

I have narrowed down the target audience mainly to the policy makers. As EV consumers' preferences on EVs provided background information about EV consumption, what I want to focus on is to tell a story about US incentives do encourage the EV sales. Such an effort can help us achieve more on green transition. However, the President Trump and his administration expressed intention to repeal the incentives. Our pace of going green would slow down. Through my storytelling with data, I want to persuade the policy makers to have deep consideration on that.

## Final design decisions

1. I have removed the graph of incentive policies in China because I don't want to mess the whole story up and make it uncohesive. I don't meant to do a comparison.
2.  I have added several labels on the graphs to directly show the number. For example, in the 'incentives' graph, the original size of circles are similar. Adding percent directly on the circle help understand the preferences on EV incentives.
