# Demographics of Social Media Users
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

[Demographics of Social Media Users](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/?tabItem=3345cffa-94a6-4e74-9272-70dee1e0e213#who-uses-each-social-media-platform)

The primary audience for this tool, I suppose, are mainly the policy makers and analysts those studying the impact of social media. Besides, I thought it was also useful for business leaders and strategists. Through the demographic analysis of social media users, policy analysts can analyze the public opinions and propoganda. Companies can decide where to allocate marketing budgets and resources, such as  advertising. 
I think this visualization is not effective for reaching those audiences. The visuals are static and lack storytelling. It merely displayed the data collection, with no further explanation or any narratives related to meaningful storytelling.

## Step two: the critique

1) What first stood out to me is that the Pew Research Center  has a highly reliable source, providing clearly-presented social media usage data.
2) This data visualization did well in credibility and clarity. I can approach to its data source on the URL. It has several notes explaining some specific data point, such as the vertical line in the chart, indicating a change in survey mode. On this web page, there is a board, "HOW WE DID THIS", explaining its methodology, purpose and survey questions as supplemental information.
3) This data visualization were really bad in the aesthetics and engagement. It solely uses charts and tables to visualize the percentage of social media users in demographic perspectives.  Besides, the visuals are purely functional, with no interactivity, designs, or storytelling elements. Users canâ€™t filter, compare, or explore the data beyond what is given.
4) I would at least change the form of charts, making it more visible and showing more on social media trends. Besides, I would add an interactive function, such as filters.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|Can you tell me what you think this is?|student,MISM Program: the heatmap shows the engagement level of users on different platforms|student, Mid 20': the heatmap shows the comparison between platform popularity|
|Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?|student,MISM Program: the effort on dividing the overwhelming line chart into three charts|student, Mid 20': the stacked bar chart clearly represents the composition of demographic elements|
|Is there anything you would change or do differently?|student,MISM Program: add some cross-platform analyses|student, Mid 20': add filter function for clearity|

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
