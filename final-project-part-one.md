# Outline 
 
## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY:
The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. has been shaped by a complex interplay of government policies, consumer preferences, and market forces. While federal and state tax incentives have played a crucial role in encouraging EV adoption, recent shifts in policy—such as potential changes to EV tax credits—have raised concerns about the future growth of the market. 

## AIM:

As a reader, I want to know the reason why EVs market in US isn't booming as that in China so that I can make an informed decision about whether purchasing an EV is financially and practically viable for me. 

## STRUCTURE:

- Overall Narrative: What the EVs market and transition in US looks like?
- Specific Questions: 1) Practical Considerations for consumers; 2) Policy of EV tax credits
- Call to Action: 1) Policy Makers; 2) Consumers; 3) Automakers

I will display the project from the data source above from three perspectives: 1) Overview of EVs Revolution (e.g. sales booming, brand share); 2) Customers' choices (e.g. average price of EVs, incentives to purchase) 3) Policy effects (e.g.Tax credits policy). By applying the data, I aim to tell a story about the EVs Revolution and its practical obstacles and policy implications.

# Method and medium

I will use **Shorthand** to plot my story. To tackle with data, I would use **Tableau Prep** for data cleaning to ensure datasets are aligned in terms of timeframes and formats. For data visualization, I would use **Tableau Desk** to create an interactive dashboard to make the story more engaging.
