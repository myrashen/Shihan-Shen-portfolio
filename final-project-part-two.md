# User research 

## Target audience

Based on my report, I want to narrow down my target audience to policy makers on how government incentives can influence EV adoption and identify key barriers and improvements from the consumerâ€™s perspective. Besides the perspective of the market shares, EVs are kind of ambitious attempts to address the climate change issue. I also want to understand how EV adoption impact the environmental issues related to consumers' daily life. 

| Audience | Concerns |
|------|------------------|
|Policy Makers|Identify challenges, motivations, and policy gaps influencing EV adoption incentives.|
|EV Owners â€“ People who have already purchased/leased an EV. |General EV experience, battery lifespan and maintenance costs, uncertainty about future resale value |
|Potential EV Buyers â€“ People considering an EV but havenâ€™t made a purchase yet.| Incentives are confusing and hard to access. Lack of charging infrastructure and range anxiety. Underdeveloped and limited EV options.|

## Interview script

*1) policy makers*
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To know about the general EV experience|How you feel about purchasing and driving an EV? & What were the biggest concerns you had before buying an EV?|
|To identify role of government incentives|Did government incentives (tax credits, rebates, free charging, etc.) influence your decision to buy an EV?(If yes, which ones were most helpful?/If no, why?) |
|To assess barriers to EV adoption|What challenges did you face when purchasing your EV? & What improvements would make EV ownership easier for you? |
|To know about the attitude towards carbon emissions|Do you believe EVs are helpful to reduce emissions and the adoption of EVs are effective way to tackle with the climate issue?|
|To get some recommendations on future incentives |Should government incentives on EVs continue? |

|------|------------------|
|To know about the general EV experience| What are the biggest concerns you have from buying an EV?|
|To identify role of government incentives|Which type of incentive (upfront rebates, tax credits, charging station discounts, etc.) would encourage you to buy an EV?|
|To assess barriers to EV adoption|What challenges do you consider when purchasing an EV? & What improvements would make EV ownership easier for you? |
|To know about the attitude towards carbon emissions|Do you believe EVs are helpful to reduce emissions and the adoption of EVs are effective way to tackle with the climate issue?|

## Interview findings

Explanation: Since my interviewees are current students, I focused my interview on consumers' perspective to give an overall observations about major concerns about EV adoption. 

| Questions               | Interview 1: student, MSPPM | Interview 2: student, 30' | Interview 3: student, MEIM |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Do you intend to own a Electric Vehicles in the future? | No. The price of car is high. | It's hard to get a car plate. | Never having thought about owning a EV. |
|Did government incentives (tax credits, rebates, free charging, etc.) impact your decision? |  Kind of. Depends on the extent of incentive.  | Yes.  | No. I prefer gasoline cars.|
|What barriers hamper you from buying a EV?|Mainly the price of car.|Lack of access to home charging.| Relatively shorter distance EVs can run.|
|Considering the environmental benefits EVs can bring, would you choose to buy one?|It depends.|Sure. EVs are definitely good to reducing carbon emissions.| Also concern about the battery safety and pollution.|




**Findings Summary:**
1) Some are not planning to own an EV, mainly due to high upfront cost. Many potential buyers havenâ€™t even considered an EV yet, suggesting that awareness & education efforts need improvement.
   
2) Mixed reactions to incentives. Some say incentives work, but only if theyâ€™re strong enough. Some respondents fully support incentives and say they influenced their decision. Others remain loyal to gasoline cars, meaning some consumers wonâ€™t switch, even with incentives.
   
ðŸ’¡Incentives are not a "one-size-fits-all" solution â€“ while they help, they wonâ€™t convert all consumers. Stronger policies are needed to target price-sensitive buyers.

3) Key obstacles stopping people from buying an EV:Car price is too high. Lack of home charging. Limited driving range.
   
ðŸ’¡EV adoption wonâ€™t increase unless price barriers are addressed. Expanding charging infrastructure is as important as financial incentives.

4) Positive responses on EVs' environmental benefits: Some support EVs for carbon reduction and would consider buying one. Others still worry about battery safety & pollution from battery disposal.
   
ðŸ’¡ Sustainability messaging should address both emissions reduction and battery safety to convince skeptical buyers.

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Make the story as a persuation for consumers |Incorporate some insightful feedback from current owners.         | 
|Add some data about how incentives promote sales of EVs | Find some sales boost after incentives are introduced.  |
|Many consumers are confused about which incentives exist and how to access them.|Add a simple flowchart or infographic explaining the EV incentive process.|
|Other countries (e.g. China) have seen greater success with EV incentives.|Make comparison between U.S. and China in EV Incentives|
|Format of storytelling| Making it more interactive and add some hooks to make the storytelling more attractive. | 
|Calling for action|Supposing the target audience of potential consumers, call for actinos to EVs consumption| 



## AI acknowledgements
I have used GenAI to brainstorm on the general outline of my storytelling. Besides, I have used GenAI to extract dataset and generate csv files to do data visualizations in Tableau.
